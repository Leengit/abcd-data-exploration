# abcd-data-exploration

Here live miscellaneous scripts and notebooks used for exploration of tabular ABCD Study data.

Notebooks that are `.py` files can be opened with Jupytext. They can be converted to `*.ipynb` files with
```bash
jupytext --to ipynb my_file.py
```

- `bipolar_study_subject_selection_abcd4.0`: Cohort selection for a study of bipolar disorder onset based on ABCD release 4.0.
- `bipolar_study_subject_selection_abcd5.0`: Update of above cohort selection for ABCD release 5.0, which has more time points and a brand new way of organizing tables.
